# Fundamentals-of-Computing
These are my programs from Rice University's Fundamentals of Computing courses: Interactive Programming part 1 and 2.
The programs are written in Python2 and require using Codeskulptor. I took the courses in Fall 2018 and Winter 2019.

From Rice University:

In part 1 of this course, we will introduce the basic elements of programming (such as expressions, conditionals, and functions) and then use these elements to create simple interactive applications such as a digital stopwatch.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game "Pong".

In part 2 of this course, we will introduce more elements of programming (such as list, dictionaries, and loops) and then use these elements to create games such as Blackjack.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game "Asteroids".  Upon completing this course, you will be able to write small, but interesting Python programs.  The next course in the specialization will begin to introduce a more principled approach to writing programs and solving computational problems that will allow you to write larger and more complex programs.
